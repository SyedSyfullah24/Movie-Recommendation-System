# Infinite Scrolling in React

This project demonstrates the implementation of **infinite scrolling** in a React application. It loads more content as the user scrolls down, optimizing performance and enhancing the user experience.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:


## Key Files and Folders

- **build/**: Contains production build files that are generated when you run `npm run build`. This is the optimized code ready for deployment.
- **public/**: Includes the static assets, such as the main HTML file (`index.html`) and the favicon. This folder is served directly by the web server.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the React app, including all components and the main application logic.
  - `App.js`: The main component that initializes the application.
  - `components/InfiniteScroll.js`: Handles the core infinite scrolling logic, fetching data as the user scrolls.
- **package.json**: Lists the project's dependencies and scripts. Use this file to install dependencies with `npm install` and to run the app.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules` and build files).
- **Readme.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up.
